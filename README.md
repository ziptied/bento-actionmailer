## Features

* **Simple integration**: Easily integrate with Rails' Action Mailer for sending transactional emails.
* **Bento API support**: Leverage Bento's HTTPS API for reliable email delivery.
* **Rails compatibility**: Works with Rails 6 and above.
* **Simplified email stack**: Ideal for straightforward applications looking to streamline their email infrastructure.

## Requirements

- Ruby on Rails 6.0+
- Bento account with API credentials

## Getting started

### Installation

Add the gem to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bento-actionmailer', github: 'bentonow/bento-actionmailer', branch: 'main'
gem 'premailer-rails' # Requirement for Rails 7.0 apps and beyond. `premailer-rails` will inline all your CSS and ensure there is both an HTML and text version for every email (Bento uses this). 
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Configuration

Add the following to your `config/application.rb` or environment-specific configuration file:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :bento_actionmailer
config.action_mailer.bento_actionmailer_settings = {
    site_uuid: "your-site-uuid",
    publishable_key: "your-publishable-key",
    secret_key: "your-secret-key"
}
```

## Usage

Use Action Mailer as you normally would in your Rails application. The gem will handle sending emails through Bento's API.

```ruby
class WelcomeMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def welcome_email
    mail(to: 'user@example.com', subject: 'Welcome to Our App!')
  end
end
```

## Things to Know

1. Currently, the gem only supports HTML emails. Text-only emails are not supported yet.
2. BCC functionality is not available in the current version.
3. Attachments are not supported in this version of the gem.
4. Custom email headers are not supported at the moment.
5. For complex email setups, consider reaching out to the Bento team for support or contributing to the project.
